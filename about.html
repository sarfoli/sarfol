<p>sadly I haven't had much time to spend on this hobby, but it is a huge passion of mine.</p>
<p>I took lessons for over 12 years. Completed my grade 8 piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music</p>
<p>favourite genre: Classics... the more melancholic the better</>
	<p>favourite artists: I am basic... Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart!</p>
	<p>my greatest flaw: starting a song I can't finish. I start a song realizing it takes me hours to learn a few bars or a couple lines and then I find a new one, just to start the process over again</p>
	<p>songs I'm currently (barely) working on: Nocturne no 1, op 9 in B flat; Clair de lune; Where is my mind</p>
