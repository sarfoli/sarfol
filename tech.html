		<center><h1>How to Build a Computer for Dummies</h1></center>
		<p>The most essential parts to include in the process are as follows: </p>
		<p>Motherboard, Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), Hard Disk Drive (HDD)/Solid State Drive (SDD), and Power Supply Unit (PSU).</p>
		<p>All of these components make up a computer, and are shelled in the case. *note* The case is NOT the computer!!</P>
		<br>
		<center><h2>I'm a Nurse. How Did I Learn This So Easily??</h2>
		<h3><p>Anatomy of a Computer</p></h3></center>
		<p>I like to think the parts of a computer can be broken down by function, and compared to the parts/functions of the human body:</p>
		<h4>The Motherboard</h4>
		<p>This part functions to tie all the components of the computer together and allows them to communicate with each other. Similar to the central nervous system, receiving peripheral signals, processing them, and sending them to an output source/device.</p>
		<h4>CPU</h4>
		<p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It receives an input, stores data (much like the brain), and produces output results. This would make the CPU cooler of the CPU comparable to the human skull! It's a protective barrier to the brain of the system.</p>
		<h4>RAM</h4>
		<p>This is the computer's main memory. It's where the operating system (OS), data, and applications are stored for quick/temporary access. This is compared to the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, where short-term memory is stored/maintained.</p>
		<h4>HHD/SSD</h4>
		<p>These are permanent data storage devices, where data is stored and read. Similar to RAM, the HHD/SSD is responsible for memory and is compared to the brain. However, it is most similar to the hippocampus, which is responsible for permanent storage of memory.</p>
		<h4>PSU</h4>
		<p>This is the power supply, which functions like the mitochondrion (the powerhouse of the cell).</p>
		<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9X7S80Px/Built-Computer.jpg"></center>
		<p>To over-simplify... all of these parts are connected together by wires to the motherboard. Once hooked up to a monitor, the computer can be powered on! (But don't forget to program the software/OS!!).</p>

<p>disclaimer: full credit goes to my favourite nerd friend Al who had the patience to teach me and let me put together his computer in his new case :)</p>
<p>who knew it would be that easy?</p>
